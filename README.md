She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame,
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me.
<hr/>---------------------------<hr/>
She is everything to me,
The unrequited dream,
The song that no one sings,
The unattainable.
She's a myth that I have to believe in,
All I need to make it real is one more reason.
