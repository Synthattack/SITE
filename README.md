<pre>
She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame,
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me.

She is everything to me,
The unrequited dream,
The song that no one sings,
The unattainable.
She's a myth that I have to believe in,
All I need to make it real is one more reason.
